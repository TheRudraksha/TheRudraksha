          <p></p><h4 class="introduction"> Rudraksha refers to a stonefruit, the dried stones of which are used as prayer beads by Hindus, as well as by Buddhists and Sikhs.
	[1] When they are ripe, rudraksha stones are covered by an inedible blue outer fruit so they are sometimes called "blueberry beads".
	[2] The rudraksha stones are produced by several species of large, evergreen, broad-leaved tree in the genus Elaeocarpus, the principal species of which is Elaeocarpus ganitrus.

<p>The stones are associated with the Hindu deity Shiva and are commonly worn for protection and for chanting mantras such as Om Namah Shivaya (Sanskrit: ॐ नमः शिवाय; Om Namaḥ Śivāya). The stones are primarily sourced from India, Indonesia, and Nepal for jewellery and malas (garlands); they are valued similarly to semi-precious stones.[citation needed] Various meanings and interpretations are attributed to rudraksha stones with different numbers of "faces" (Sanskrit: मुख, romanized: mukha, lit. 'face') or locules, and rare or unique stones are highly prized and valued.</p>
<H3><u>Etymology</u></H3>
<p>Rudraksha is a Sanskrit compound word consisting of Rudra (Sanskrit: रुद्र) and akṣa (Sanskrit: अक्ष).[4][a] Sanskrit dictionaries translate akṣa (Sanskrit: अक्ष) as eyes,[5] as do many prominent Hindus such as Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and Kamal Narayan Seetha; accordingly, rudraksha may be interpreted as meaning "eyes of Rudra".[6][page needed] Rudra is a Vedic precursor to Shiva.</p>
<H3><u>Rudraksha tree</u></H3>
<P>Of the 300 species of Elaeocarpus, 35 are found in India. The principal species of this genus is Elaeocarpus ganitrus, which has the common name of "rudraksha tree", and is found from the Gangetic plain in the foothills of the Himalayas to Nepal, South and Southeast Asia, parts of Australia, Guam, and Hawaii.[7]

Elaeocarpus ganitrus trees grow to 60–80 ft (18–24 m). They are evergreen trees which grow quickly, and as they mature their roots form buttresses, rising up near the trunk and radiating out along the surface of the ground.[citation needed]</P>

<h3><u>Types of rudraksha stones</u></h3>
<p>Rudraksha stones are described as having a number of facets or "faces" (mukhi) which are separated by a line or cleft along the stone. Stones typically have between 1 and 21 faces, although most have between 4 and 6 faces. Those with a single face are the rarest. Rudrakshas from Nepal are between 20 and 35 mm (0.79 and 1.38 in) and those from Indonesia are between 5 and 25 mm (0.20 and 0.98 in). Rudraksha stones are most often brown, although white, red, yellow, or black stones may also be found.[citation needed]

Many types of stone are described. Gauri shankar are two stones which are naturally conjoined. Sawar are gauri shankar in which one of the conjoined stones has just one face. Ganesha are stones which have a trunk-like protrusion on their bodies. Trijuti are three stones which are naturally conjoined. Other rare types include veda (4 conjoined sawars) and dwaita (2 conjoined sawars).[8]</p>
